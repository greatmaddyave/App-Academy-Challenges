## Synopsis

Hello, and welcome to my practice codes for the  **Thinkful appAcademy course code challenges**. There are no packages in this file as this is an organization of singular .rb files that run a specific method from the challenges presented in the course work.

## Code Example

You will find the appAcademy practice test along with other coding supplimentary file displaying **methods** that return the provided examples to ensure your code is passing.

## Motivation

This project is part of my Thinkful.com appAcademy course work. My hope is to bring all of my study material (and accomplishments) into one place. 

## Installation

You can view each challenge by folder by clicking on the **.rb** file or download by clicking the link above. Please feel free to comment on any of my work.
